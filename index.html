        <h1>How Not to Explode</h2>
        <p>This is a version of the classic game, Minesweeper. Reveal all tiles except the ten hidden mines, avoiding any sudden explosion. If a number appears, that means there are that many mines adjacent (including diagonals) to the numbered tile. When landing on an empty tile, connecting empty tiles and the neighboring numbered tiles are revealed. Needless to say, once you hit a mine, it's game over.</p>
        <p>When you think you've revealed all tiles around the hidden mines, hit the Check &#xf00c; to validate your efforts. Win or lose, you can start another game and randomly generate new hidden mines with Refresh &#xf021;. If you feel the need to cheat, poke the Eye &#xf06e; to see where all the mines are placed. You can also switch between normal and hard mode, increasing the number of hidden mines from ten to twenty. Good luck!</p>
